A two storied building at the aristocratic area in Amman. There was no house near it. The house was surrounded by wall which was eight-feet high. Although all the lights of the exterior side of the house were put out, the front side of the northern part was brightened by the light form the public lamppost of the road. The silver-coloured iron-gate was glistening as light fell onto it.

Taking the letter of Ahmad Musa, Shafiq came out using the gate with a slow footsteps. While starting the car, Shafiq looked behind instantly, a black land rover positioned behind them coming out from beside the chest of the darkness. In order to ensure his suspicion, Shafiq told driver to drive his car in full speed. Driver objected that and said, “It's not easy to increase more speed than this in this zigzag road, sir.”

Shafiq presented a symbolical mark before the eyes of the Driver and said, “This is needed, driver.” Seeing the symbolical mark of Saimum, Driver shook his head and gave a respectful salaam and said, “Think this car and myself as your own from now on, sir.”

Keeping his eyes in the rear-view mirror, Shafiq said, “Does everybody think such thing like you, driver?”

“Everybody thinks more beautifully. There is nobody but unfortunate like me. In this critical moment of our nation, nothing is done by me except the adoration of the belly.”

Shafiq kept his hand onto the back of the driver and said, “Who says you don’t do anything, brother? Your support and love are supplying us the power and inspiration.”

Keeping off his eyes from the rear-view mirror, Shafiq said, “The car in the back is following us, driver.”

Looking into the rear-view mirror with a thoughtful face, the driver said, “Every lane and alley of the city is in the mirror of my finger-nail. If you say, we can escape from them within 5 minutes.”

- “No, it cannot, driver. Showing enemy back is the opposite of our heritage. A member of Saimum never go ahead keeping an enemy alive. Turn the car’s speed a bit of slow in front of the tree at the time of crossing. You will continue to drive the car after my descending. Wait for me at the mouth of Sultan Sarah Uddin Road.”

Shafiq dashed out himself from the running car through the open door in a dark space near the tree. Looking back, he felt comforted. The head-light of the rear car was still far behind. Relieved, he took out a hand-grenade from the pocket and set the safety pin holding revolver in another hand.

Aiming at the front car, the rear car was proceeding in complete relax. Shafiq was waiting breathlessly under the tree behind a stone.

No sooner had the car come parallel to the tree than he fired the first bullet from his revolver equipped with silencer. A back tyre burst with violent noise. The car stopped after a while.

What Shafiq expected came true. Opening door from both sides of the car, two men stepped out assuming a usual tyre burst. One was a dwarfish with flat nose, round mouth and yellow-coloured. His being a Chinese was revealed at first glance. The latter was tall and white. Either of them were in black pant and black coat. They startled while verifying the tyre. Instantly their hands entered inside their pockets. But, it was too late. Shafiq's revolver made two mild sounds. Both the bodies collapsed.

Shafiq quickly approached towards them. He found no other papers but revolver, cigarette case, lighter, hand bomb in their pockets.

There were a sub-machine gun and an attaché case left in the car. Shafiq came out with the attaché case hoping to find any clues.

Before leaving, he informed the on-duty police of the two corpses asking to dispose them shortly.


Ahmad Musa strolled for a while restlessly after sending Shafiq. He was trying to figure something out. Sudden trip to somewhere for some reason is not unusual for Hasan Tariq. But, how can that be? It's 12 am now. He was supposed to reach here at 11 pm this night. Above all, most astonishingly his wireless was silent. Then… Thinking, his eyes flared up. As if fire of vengeance were scattering therein. An amazing rapt-attention possessed the eyes little by little. His vision went outside through the window. Going past the black curtain of dark horizon, his thought passed over Tibet, The Hindu Kush, The Karakoram mountain ranges. A nice-looking village in the region of Gansu, East Turkestan. How delightful and pleasant the days were! They used to roam around like a piece of restless desert breeze. The game of hide-and-seek continued all day long in the prickly bushes. Sitting on father's lap, how many stories they listened to staring at stars in the sky! On the way of listening mind travelled to another world. The whole world was in darkness. A great man came to Arabia. A piece of light fell upon his hand which spread to all directions overcoming much whirlwind and storm. A portion of it reached Turkestan as well. Many a time dad had to stop the story before finishing. A sweet spell of melody by the eldest uncle would reach from the mosque. Although he did not understand a word, he enjoyed the tone very much. Days were passing in such a way, would continue to pass as well. But a storm hit the well-ordered life style. Only bloods were left behind. Stood holding the window-bar, his face became strong in an inexpressible pain and firmness. Then he said, “You must account for the persecution you are inflicting on the Muslims in Central Asia, Xinjiang, Philippine, Palestine, Ethiopia, Chad. You can form 'SEATO', 'CENTO', 'NATO', make 'Wars' treaty, but when we come forward to do something, it becomes 'fanaticism', 'bigotry'?“

While pulling the window leaves, Ahmad Musa looked down and got alarmed. A piece of dim light like that of cat's eye lit suddenly and extinguished. Was that pencil torch? Ahmad Musa became alerted. He quickly looked through the binocular devised especially for darkness. Outer darkness got much transparent. A black dressed figure was seen to have sat upon the wall climbing through hook-attached rope. The figure descended little by little. Then it advanced along the wall stealthily like a hunting cat.
Getting prepared, Musa came downstairs and stood on the mouth of staircase by the side of switch-board behind a pillar.

The figure silently came to the veranda. He seemed to be nothing but a piece of coagulated darkness. He reached within some 20 yards. Suddenly, he stopped. Pressing left thumb on switch and taking the revolver in the right hand, Ahmad Musa came out from hiding. The figure got overwhelmed with the suddenness of occurrence. Raising the revolver barrel at fixed target, Ahmad Musa said, “I don't miss target much, drop your revolver. Also drop your pencil-headed revolver from left hand.”

Still and motionless eyes of the figure read something on Ahmad Musa's eye. Then after a short hesitation, he dropped both the arms on the floor.
Sighting a shadow of a person moving beside, Ahmad Musa got alarmed. He promptly reclined to a side. Instantly a sound came from the backside with a thud. The man in the front fell with a penetrating scream. Ahmad Musa too fired from his revolver.
Revolver fell from the hand of the man in the rear without letting him apprehend anything. The man tried to raise the left hand up. Ahmad Musa roared, “Lower your hand or the next bullet will penetrate through your heart instead of the hand.”
The man carried the order out. His right hand was bleeding in drops. The sound of car-stopping in the outer gate came at that time. Ahmad Musa became all ears. But, his revolver barrel didn't move at all. A familiar signal came from outside. Faruq arrived there just seconds after Ahmad Musa had responded to that. Reaching, he said, “It's exactly what I thought, I didn't mishear.”

“You might analyse those later. First, take out the second revolver from this guest of us. Touch carefully, something else may be left in pockets.”

It was then 1.00 PM. Ahmad Musa and Faruk Amin were sitting in a table facing each other. A small chit was in front of Ahmad Musa:

“A quite new element. WRF is active- Amman being their target at present- two alpines at trouser band as a 'V' make their identity.”

Slowly rising his head out of the chit, Ahmad Musa said, “Who is this WRF appeared beside the 'MOSAD' of Jews and the 'CIA' of the westerners? What do they want?” Looking at Faruk, Musa said, “Faruk, Did you find out the party our today's guest belong to?”

Faruk said, “Yes, WRF. I've found two alpines at their trouser band just like the symbol 'V'.”

Looking at the watch, Ahmad Musa said, “We haven't got enough time. Besides it's necessary to take steps about him; it's not a good idea to carry - any business - specially like these kind of dangerous-burdens. But let's examine him before.”

A deep blue colour was all around. Reflecting that light into the pigeon-white walls, it created a dreamy environment. He pulled out the needle of a pentacle injection from the right of the man who was half-lying in the easy-chair. Then with a gentle smile, Ahmad Musa said, “You may feel a little bit tired and sleepy for several minutes, then everything will be okay. You will remember the previous speeches and there will be no trouble in speaking.“

The eyes of the man was closed. Pulling a chair Ahmad Musa sat there in front of him. Then he spoke slowly, “Open Your eyes, look at my eyes.” The man opened his eyes very slowly.

Ahmad Musa asked, “What's you name?”

- Mikhail Iakubov.

- What is your country?

- Ukraine.

- But you look like a Turkey?

- My parents were Turkey.

- How?

- I was a child of the Siberian Children Refugee Camp.

- Then were your parents Muslims?

- I don't know. But in that refugee-camp, at the time of our training, an strange old man once told me that, all those Turkey Muslims who were consigned in Siberia after the revolution in October, 1917, I was a son of one of those.

- Now, what do you think about your acquaintance?

- I don't care about my previous-acquaintance.

- Well, what is WRF?

- World Red Forces, the front-army of the World Communists Movement.

- Are you a member of this?

- Yes.

- Why did you come here today?

- WRF has been looking for you since many days. There's an order on us to kill or catch you.

- Why do you give such a 'kind look' to Saimum?

- Saimum is the number one enemy of the World Communists Movement.

- Where's the head-quarter of WRF? Who are organised?

- It has no fixed head-quarter. Its head-quarter is there where the Central Council stays. WRF is a non-government organization made in accompany with the communist powers.

- Again, Where and how is the WRF working?

- I don't know. I only know that, the Muslim countries has been divided into units for this.

- Who gave you the inquiry of this place today?

- I don't know. I only kept the order.

- The order came from where?

- I found a letter in a wooden-box kept in the room of a house numbered 233 on Al-Kabir Road where the order was written.

- Do you know Hasan Tarik?

- I heard his name.

- We don't heard him for ten hours. Do you know about him?

- We are only informed of the matter that we are related, not further than that.

His eyes are, as it were, being closed with a great fatigue, again. Looking at Faruk, Musa said. “Take him away now. And surely, give him a last chance remembering him of the heritage of his forefathers.”
